In this modern age where internet addiction has become rampant, it is productify that comes to your rescue. The basic idea behind the extension is to provide users with a wholesome and productive browsing experience on the internet. This is done by providing the user with the tools to control what he/she views on the internet and various other features that will assist him/her in browsing productively. Productify allows the user to block websites that he considers to be distracting, moving it out of his way. Websites can be unblocked at user's discretion. Users can find the meaning, translation and pronunciation of text on a website by selecting and right clicking it. Productify also comes with its own mobile app! Users can save articles from a website and view it on their app (offline). Words searched for- by the user are stored into a personalized dictionary which is made available on the mobile app. Simultaneously, Productify displays usage statistics (time spent on websites, number of articles saved, number of words searched for meaning,etc) of the user that will provide a measure of his productiveness.",

There are different roles in the web application namely Event Managers, Volunteers, Participants and Administrator. Users are supposed to sign up for the first time. Admin will give access to users as event managers after contacting him according to the requirement. They can create events and add teams and assign volunteers to each and every team. Students can directly register for the event and join a particular team. Then users who are assigned as volunteers by event managers can manage the team like check-in and check out the participants during the event. Event Managers can see the statistics of the registrations of a particular event.",
